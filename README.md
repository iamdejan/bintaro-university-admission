# Bintaro University Admission

This is a dummy project for a fake university. My goal here is to learn:-
- Cookie-based authentication (especially HttpOnly cookies); and
- [Time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password), which is based on [RFC 6238](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238.html).
